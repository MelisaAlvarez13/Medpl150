In Susan Sontag's, "In Plato's Cave" , the idea that photography is a tool "used to collect the world" (para. 2) expresses the convenience and power a camera holds. Sontag shares that photographs capture the essence and demonstrates proof of life or existence or as Sontag sees it , capturing the worlds experiences . The scales and stakes in how photography is seen as ,differ in where the photographers intent lies. Sontag makes you think of how the reasoning behind capturing pictures can be seen as "limitations or pretensions", whether or not the thoughtfulness, knowledge or creativity behind the camera are done at random or deliberately lie on gaining something from taking the image. She states that photography is commonly used as, "a social rite, a defense against anxiety, and a tool of power". (pg.2) mentioning again the appropriation on the object of focus as the photographers intent relies behind the camera. As time and society continue to change the art of taking photos shifts as well, the significance on how these prints are monetized and utilized reflect how society as a whole collectively thinks.

"Photographed images do not seem to be statements about the world so much as pieces of it, miniatures of reality that anyone can make or acquire" (pg.1) This Made me realize how photographs are so important and embedded in society , when she speaks about how valuable photographs become that they get sold and repurposed for creative purposes to academic or lawful ones as well. As they get shared, a point in time , the photographer and the object of focus get immortalized. Yet Susan Sontag explains that the way the image gets repurposed defines the quality and emotional impact on viewers. The intent behind the lens is not solely dependent on the photographers project goal but the emotional state or external factors that influenced the photographer or focus object at that specific time. "To take a picture is to have an interest in things as they are, in the status quo remaining unchanged (at least for as long as it takes to get a "good" picture), to be in complicity with whatever makes a subject interesting, worth photographing ! including, when that is the interest, another person's pain or misfortune." (pg.3) Emotional states such as anxiety , gratitude and even anger , hatred and lust amplify the way these pictures are perceived at large within the projects. Sontag describes photography in very symbolic ways , comparing the action to sublimated murder or perverted-ness, while keeping a distance with their object either physically or emotionally. Speaking on how there is desire of artistry whilst also feeling unethical invasion of privacy or immoral when considering the context of situations. "The limit of photographic knowledge of the world is that, while it can goad conscience, it can, finally, never be ethical or political knowledge. The knowledge gained through still photographs will always be some kind of sentimentalism, whether cynical or humanist."(pg.6) Bringing up the negative ways photography can be used , such as propaganda , pornography and tactlessness. Overall emphasizing having consideration on how this art form is used, as it promotes the feeling of having world knowledge easily accessible.
