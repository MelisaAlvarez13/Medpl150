My website and art is meant to reflect the attention to beauty in the mundane, while also highlighting the importance and depth of social issues and sharpening my eye for aesthetics. My experiences lie in digital design, collages, and casual photography. Mixing personal identity with activism and environment. Personal identity , Fashion history , pop culture, Punk symbolism , mysticism and eclecticism are components in my preferred style of art within digital design , film or photography. Influences of pop art and nostalgic vapor wave along with political symbolism from other artists and eras such as the 60s-90s are usually embedded in my works. Visuals and art work from Caro knapp , petra collins and barbra kruger are also inspirations in my work and usually I incorporate music in my creative process one way or another from using lyrics or songs to start a piece or set the vibe I go for to simply listening as I work. It’s difficult to try and make art that isn’t repetitive or the messages in my art don't sound redundant and common that they become washed down. However everything is always repurposed and nothing can be truly original but it’s the goal to create new perspectives. Hopefully this will further my visualist designer portfolio and become familiar with new things that could help me in the future. I would like to use this experience as another tool for my own future business, to promote original content on my socials and grow my design skill sets and strategies for potential career paths.
