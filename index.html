 <h1> MELISA ALVAREZ : My First Web Page</h1>
 <img src="Images/webpage logo mel.png"/>
  <p>
My website and art is meant to reflect the attention to beauty in the mundane,
while also highlighting the importance and depth of social issues and sharpening my eye for aesthetics.
My experiences lying in digital design, collages, and casual photogrpahy.
Mixing personal identity with activism and environment.
